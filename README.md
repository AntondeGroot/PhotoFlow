# PhotoFlow

- To improve the workflow of selecting photos to edit /delete
- Select photos to print
- Collect them and put them in a specified folder so that you can print them at a store.

## Notes
- **If you need to edit a lot of photos one after the other:** then it's advisable to use GIMP instead of Lightroom. With GIMP the program will import your image quite fast. With Lightroom it first needs to start the program which will take a while, then it will only have the image in the library after which you need to press on 'develop' and load it there again before you can edit it.
- **If you need to edit a lot of photos simultaneously:** then it's advisable to use Lightroom. You could first use this program to cut down the clutter and remove the obviously bad photos. Then you can export all the files into a single folder (if they were spread over multiple folders) and then use lightroom to import all the photos and edit them simultaneously.
