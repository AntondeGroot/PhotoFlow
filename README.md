# PhotoFlow

- To improve the workflow of selecting photo's to edit /delete
- Select photo's to print
- Collect them and put them in a specified folder so that you can print them at a store.

## Notes
- If you need to edit a lot of photo's one after the other: then it's advisable to use GIMP instead of Lightroom. With GIMP the program will import your image quite fast. With Lightroom it first needs to start the program which will take a while, then it will only have the image in the library after which you need to press on 'develop' and load it there for it to be editable.
- If you need to edit a lot of photo's simultaneously: then it's advisable to use Lightroom. You could first use this program to cut down the clutter and remove the obviously bad photo's. Then you can export all the files into a single folder (if they were spread over multiple folders) and then use lightroom to import all the photo's and edit them simultaneously.
